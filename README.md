# stdtable : module to standardize cross-tabulations to pre-specified row and column totals

The purpose of the `stdtable` command is to describe the association between two categorical 
variables nett of the association imposed on the table by the marginal distributions or
make cross-tabulations comparable across groups by removing
differences due to differences in the marginal distributions. The
`stdtable` command does that by standardizing a cross-tabulation by
fixing the row and column totals.
